<Line number/Range>, <Identified Code Smell>, Reason

Warehouse.java

<Line 4-6>, <Global Variables>, Contains public fields with no encapsulation
<Line 8-9>, <Bad Naming>, Constructor declared with ambiguous parameter

GlobalInventoryData

<Line 8>, <Bad Naming>, Wrong naming format of class. It should be upper camelcase.
<Lines 9-13>, <Global Variables> Use of public static fields makes the code dependent
<Line 1-14>, <Data Class>, Class only holds data with no encapsulation
<Lines 1-14>, <Feature Envy>, uses too much features of other class

InventorySystem

<Line 6, 29>, <Bad Naming>, Wrong naming format of class. It should be upper camelcase. CreatedAt should be more specific date or time.
<Line 11-19, 24-29,33-35>, <Global Variables>, Contains public fields with no encapsulation
<Lines 41-67>, <Long Method>, addProduct method if very long.
<Lines 44-67>, <Conditional Complexity>, addProduct method contains very long and nested if-else statements.
<Lines 85,87,91>, <Magic Numbers>, Hard-coded values (0.85, 0.95, 0.8) in discount calculations
<Lines 44-67>, <Switch Statement>, calculateFinalPrice method uses switch instead of polymorphism.
<Lines 104-119>, <Duplicate Method>, calculateWarehouseValue, calculateTotalInventoryValue, calculateTotalInventoryValue all of these methods do similar calculations.
<Lines 132-167>, <Long Method>, processOrder method if very long.
<Line 14, 18, 28, 29>, <Primitive Obsession>, Use of String for product category, discount, createdAt(DATE), status
<Lines 170-197>, <Duplicate Method>, report generation methods do similar calculations.
<Line 170, 185>, <Poor Naming>, Naming Convention, Method names should not start with uppercase
<Lines 107,114,124,140>, <Message Chaining>, calling a series of methods depending on each other


ReportScheduler
<Line 3>, <Bad Naming>, Wrong naming format of class. It should be upper camelcase.
<Line 5>, <Use of Static>, Static method with no real implementation
